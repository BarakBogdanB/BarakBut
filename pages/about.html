          <h2>Barak<br />But</h2>
          <h5>25 years old, Male, Israel</h5>
          <p>
            After 14 years of studying I graduated college with an
            <br />Electrical Practical Engineer degree, after which <br />I was
            drafted and have served in the Israeli Air Force <br />for 3 years
            as a First-class technician and a UAV instructor. <br />After being
            discharged with the rank of staff sergeant <br />I have worked as an
            Electrical Technician for 2 years. <br />
            In all those years, slowly but surely I found out about <br />how
            much I enjoyed finding bugs and glitches in the <br />applications I
            was using and games I was playing. <br />
            As such I decided to make a drastic move and <br />chance my career
            path to that of a QA person.
